            <br><br>
            In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts
            into
            aggressive creatures known as the Infected. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the
            chaos
            with his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and daughter Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a
            soldier and dies in Joel's arms.
            <br><br>
            Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in totalitarian
            quarantine
            zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups, leaving buildings and houses deserted. Joel works as a
            smuggler with his partner Tess (Annie Wersching) in the quarantine zone in the North End of Boston,
            Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen
            weapons
            cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia
            opposing the quarantine zone authorities.
            <br><br>
            The leader of the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), promises to double their cache in return for
            smuggling a
            teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the
            quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a government
            patrol,
            they discover Ellie is infected. Symptoms normally occur within two days, but Ellie claims she was infected
            three weeks earlier and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination
            through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has
            been
            bitten by an infected and, believing in Ellie's importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so
            Joel
            and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the
            remaining
            Fireflies.
            <br><br>
            With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler and survivalist who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a
            working
            vehicle from Bill's neighborhood in Lincoln. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are
            ambushed
            by bandits, and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji
            Jeter).
            After they escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam
            attacks
            Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead before taking his own life. In the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy
            in
            Jackson, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife Maria
            (Ashley Scott). Joel decides to leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he lets her
            stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find
            the
            university abandoned, but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. The two
            are
            attacked by bandits, and Joel is severely wounded while escaping.
            <br><br>
            During the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on
            Ellie to
            care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David (Nolan North) and James (Reuben Langdon), scavengers
            willing to trade medicine for food. After David reveals that the university bandits were part of his group,
            Ellie becomes hostile. She manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is captured; David intends to
            recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a
            burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches her just
            as
            she kills David with a machete, an act that traumatizes her, and Joel comforts her before they flee.
            <br><br>
            In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning
            before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being
            prepared
            for surgery: in hope of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected
            portion of
            Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room,
            kills the lead surgeon, and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by
            Marlene,
            whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On the drive out of the city, when
            Ellie
            wakes up, Joel claims that the Fireflies had found many other immune people, but were unable to create a
            cure
            and that they have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's settlement, Ellie expresses her survivor
            guilt.
            At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true.
