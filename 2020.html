            Joel Miller (Troy Baker) confesses to his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) his responsibility in preventing
            the Fireflies attempting to find a cure for the Cordyceps fungus pandemic by saving Ellie (Ashley Johnson)
            from an operation that would have killed her. Four years later, Joel and Ellie have built a life in Jackson,
            Wyoming, though their relationship has become strained. While on patrol, Joel and Tommy rescue a stranger,
            Abby Anderson (Laura Bailey), from an Infected horde. They return to an outpost run by Abby's group, former
            Fireflies now part of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), a militia group based in Seattle, Washington.
            The group attack Joel and Tommy; Abby seeks revenge against Joel for murdering her father, the Firefly
            surgeon (Derek Phillips) who was to perform the operation on Ellie. Meanwhile, Ellie and her girlfriend Dina
            (Shannon Woodward) leave Jackson in search of the brothers. Ellie enters the WLF camp to witness Abby beat
            Joel to death, and swears revenge.
            <br><br>
            Tommy sets out for Seattle to hunt Abby, and Ellie and Dina follow him. After escaping a WLF ambush, Ellie
            reveals her immunity to Dina, who in turn reveals she is pregnant. The next day, Ellie pursues Tommy alone
            and encounters Jesse (Stephen Chang), Dina's ex-boyfriend, who followed them to Seattle. While searching for
            Abby's friend, Nora Harris (Chelsea Tavares), Ellie encounters the Seraphites, a religious cult locked in a
            battle with the WLF over control of Seattle. Ellie tracks down Nora and tortures her for information on
            Abby's location, which traumatizes Ellie. The following day, she kills two more members of Abby's group, the
            pregnant Mel (Ashly Burch) and her boyfriend Owen Moore (Patrick Fugit). A flashback reveals that, two years
            earlier, Ellie traveled to the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City and learned the truth. Devastated, she cut
            ties with Joel. In the present, Ellie's group is ambushed by Abby, who kills Jesse and holds Tommy hostage.
            <br><br>
            Three days earlier, Abby learns that Owen, her ex-boyfriend, has gone missing while investigating Seraphite
            activity. Abby searches for Owen and is captured by the Seraphites. She is rescued by Yara (Victoria Grace)
            and Lev (Ian Alexander), Seraphite siblings who have been branded apostates after Lev defied Seraphite
            traditions. Though Yara suffers a broken arm, Abby leaves them to find Owen who, disillusioned with the war,
            plans to sail to Santa Barbara, California, where the Fireflies may be regrouping. Abby returns to rescue
            Yara and Lev, and travels across Seattle with Lev to retrieve medical supplies from the WLF hospital so Mel
            can amputate Yara's arm. After the surgery, Lev runs away to convince his devout mother to leave the
            Seraphite cult, forcing Abby and Yara to pursue him. They find him in the Seraphite settlement, where Lev
            has accidentally killed his mother in self-defense. The trio flee as the WLF begins an assault on the
            Seraphites. Abby betrays the WLF to save Lev, and Yara sacrifices herself to allow Abby and Lev to escape.
            The pair return to find Owen and Mel dead and a map left by Ellie leading to her hideout. Abby shoots Tommy,
            impairing him, and brawls with Ellie and Dina, overpowering them. At Lev's insistence, Abby spares them and
            tells them to leave Seattle.
            <br><br>
            Several months later, Ellie and Dina are living on a farm, raising Dina and Jesse's son, though Ellie
            suffers from post-traumatic stress. When Tommy arrives with information on Abby's whereabouts, Ellie leaves
            to find her, despite Dina's pleas to stay. Abby and Lev arrive in Santa Barbara searching for the Fireflies,
            who they discover are regrouping at Catalina Island, California, but are captured, tortured, and left to die
            by the slave-keeping Rattlers. Ellie arrives at Santa Barbara and rescues the pair. Threatening to kill Lev,
            Ellie forces Abby to fight her, during which Abby bites off two of Ellie's fingers. Ellie overpowers her but
            has a change of heart and lets her live. Abby and Lev sail to the Fireflies. Ellie returns to the farmhouse
            and finds it empty. She tries to play Joel's guitar with her damaged hand, recalls her last conversation
            with Joel in which she expressed her willingness to forgive him, and leaves.
