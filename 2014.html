            After an ambush that leaves Joel (Troy Baker) severely injured, Ellie (Ashley Johnson) searches an abandoned
            mall in Colorado for supplies to heal him. She discovers a medical kit in a derelict military helicopter
            that has crashed through the roof. Making her way back to the unconscious Joel, Ellie must deal with the
            Infected and members of the hostile human group who injured Joel in the first place. She fights her way back
            to Joel, treats his injury, and takes him to a hideout to see out the worsening winter.
            <br><br>
            Months earlier, three weeks before Ellie meets Joel, Riley Abel (Yaani King) surprises her at their Boston
            military boarding school after running away over a month ago. She reveals that she has joined the Fireflies,
            a revolutionary militia group, and takes Ellie to explore an abandoned mall. They have fun with a carousel,
            photo booth, arcade, and Halloween store before having a water gun fight. Riley reveals that she has been
            assigned to a group of Fireflies in a different city, but broke the rules to come and see Ellie one last
            time. The girls argue, but Ellie eventually tells Riley that she supports her decision as she knows Riley
            has wanted it for a long time. Before they part ways, Riley plugs Ellie's Walkman into the sound system of
            an electronics store, and the two dance on a display case to Etta James's cover of "I Got You Babe". Ellie
            tearfully begs Riley not to leave; Riley agrees and rips her Firefly pendant off, prompting Ellie to kiss
            her. Riley responds positively, though the two are then chased by a horde of Infected alerted by the music.
            They outrun most of the Infected and kill the remainder, getting bitten in the process. They briefly
            consider shooting themselves to prevent the infection taking over them, but instead choose to spend their
            final hours together. While Riley is assumed to have succumbed to the infection, Ellie discovers that she is
            immune, triggering the events of The Last of Us.
